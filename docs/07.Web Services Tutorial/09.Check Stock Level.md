`Version: 1.2 | Release Date: 07/02/2024`

## Scenario

ABC Fruit Company has experienced significant success as a result of its marketing campaign, leading to an increase in online orders through their web store. 

This surge in demand has placed considerable strain on the delivery team, who have discovered that certain products are in short supply. 

Consequently, customer service representatives are occupied with contacting customers to delay deliveries. 

To prevent a similar crisis in the future, Chris has been consulted. 

Chris has decided to implement a feature in the online store that checks the inventory level before customers add products to their cart.
