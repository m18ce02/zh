`Version: 1.2 | Release Date: 07/02/2024`

## Introduction

The primary purpose for aiM18 system is to enhance your data management. 

With aiM18, data only needs to be input once and can be viewed everywhere.

## Aim

After reading this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Retrieve Data from aiM18
2. Obtain Module Record Unique ID

## Scenario

Chris is IT Manager of ABC Fruit Company. He is responsible for maintaining ABC Fruit Catalog which shows imported fruits and local fruits separately.

![wst01](/assets/wst01.png)

Jane, manager from Marketing Department, contacts Chris from time to time for adding different new products. 

Due to heavy workload on Chris, he often fails to release latest catalog on time. 

This hindered promotion campaigns proposed by Jane.

Chris decides to solve it by using aiM18 Data Search Web Service.

## Refer to the document

The following content demonstrating how to retrieve data from aiM18. 

For more detail, please refer to [the complete documentation](/pages/c79a4a/#data-search-web-service) for `search` services.

```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

Request request = new Request.Builder()
  .url("http://127.0.0.1:8080/jsf/rfws/search/search?stSearch=employee&startRow=1&endRow=10")
  .get()
  .addHeader("authorization", "Bearer MjZhZGNjMDctODVhZS00MmE0LWI3ZmEtNzRhMTQwZGZiNTY0")
  .addHeader("client_id", "C-SGF2aWQncyBhcHBsaWNhdGlvbjIwMTctMDItMTAxNjc=")
  .addHeader("cache-control", "no-cache")
  .build();

Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
```

**HTTP Request**

`GET http://[server]/jsf/rfws/search/search?stSearch=[stSearchName]&startRow=[startRow]&endRow=[endRow]`

## Understanding stSearch

aiM18 Data Search Web Service relies solely on `stSearch` parameter.

Within the aiM18 platform, `stSearch` is also referred to as [the Lookup](/pages/7488ac/#lookup).

Lookup is a searching scheme predefined in aiM18, it covers information of tables, sorting and table joins involved in a search.

You can obtain `stSearch code` by visiting **Lookup** in aiM18:

![wst02](/assets/wst02.png)

In aiM18, the same module can have many different `stSearch`. Some settings are predefined by the system, while others can be customized by the user.

A standard `stSearch` is provided by each module, which should be suitable for most scenarios.

For instance, by visiting the `Product / Material` editor, you can access the standard `stSearch` used by this module.

![wst04](/assets/wst04.png)

**1. Click `Edit Query`**

![wst05](/assets/wst05.png)

**2. Click `Lookup`**

The code in brackets is the `stSearch code` we want.

## Buildup Search Condition

Next we need to prepare different product lists which show imported fruits and local fruits respectively. 

aiM18 Data Search Web Service allows you to provide a SQL like WHERE clause to filter data.

![wst07](/assets/wst07.png)

Assume [Series] is the field to distinguish product, we need to know its corresponding column name in Database.

aiM18 provides a convenient way for you to know the corresponding database column for a field directly on the interface. 

First, you need to enable [Show Field Name] Option in the interface settings.

![wst08](/assets/wst08.png)

Next, place the cursor on the column you want to view, in this case it is [Series], and the system will display the corresponding field information.

![wst09](/assets/wst09.png)

## Get ID by Code

After collecting above information, it is easy to come up with the following condition:

::: note For imported fruits:
seriesId=equals=IMPORT
:::

::: note For local fruits:
seriesId=equals=LOCAL
::: 

For all lookup fields in aiM18, When building `Search Condition`, we should use `record id` instead of `record code`.  

Record id can be obtained by using [Get Id by Code Web Service](/pages/c79a4a/#get-id-by-code-web-service).

**Sample request to find Id of Series**

```java
GET `http://[server]/jsf/rfws/entity/getIdByCode/series?menuCode=series&code=IMPORT`

GET `http://[server]/jsf/rfws/entity/getIdByCode/series?menuCode=series&code=LOCAL`
```

**Sample Response**

```json
{"withMulti":false,"id":"1","withRight":true}

{"withMulti":false,"id":"2","withRight":true}
```

## Summarize all the steps together

**Sample request to search Products where Series = `LOCAL`**

```java
GET http://[server]/jsf/rfws/search/search?stSearch=pro&conds=seriesId=equals=2
```

**Sample Response**

```json
{
 "size":{
	 "size":4,
	 "values":[
		{"code":"Orange","desc":"Local Orange","iRev":2,"id":8 ...},
		{"code":"Banana","desc":"Local Banana","iRev":2,"id":6 ...},
		{"code":"Apple","desc":"Local Apple","iRev":2,"id":5 ...},
		{"code":"Peach","desc":"Local Peach","iRev":2,"id":7 ...}
	 ]
 }
}
```

## FAQ

**1. How can I know I have to use id instead of the code?**

You can check by Data Dictionary. All fields with Lookup value are storing the reference id.
