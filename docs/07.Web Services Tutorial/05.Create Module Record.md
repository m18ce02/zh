`Version: 1.2 | Release Date: 07/02/2024`

## Introduction

From [last chapter](/pages/1589cf/), you should be familiar with our basic Web Service in obtaining the required information for filling in a [SqlEntity](/pages/7488ac/#sqlentity).

## Aim

After reading this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Create a module record through Web Service
2. Understand Data Dictionary in aiM18
3. Mastering best practice to create a module record

## Scenario

Chris Wong is IT Manager of ABC Fruit Company. Customers can order fruits from the Online Shop:

![wst12](/assets/wst12.png)

![wst13](/assets/wst13.png)

Chris collects orders received from online shop every day and passes data to Sales Department for data entry into aiM18 ERP System. 

Manager of Sales Department complaints that data volume is too huge. 

It is very time consuming to input data manually. 

Other than using importation provided in aiM18 ERP System, Chris decides to automate this process with the help of `Save Entity` Service.

## Refer to the document

The following content is a fragment of the **WebServices** document, demonstrating how to save a *Document* to a specific module.

Please refer to the complete documentation [here](/pages/c79a4a/#save-entity).

**HTTP Request**

`PUT http://[server]/jsf/rfws/entity/s/save/[module]?menuCode=[menuCode]`

**Parameters**

| Name              | Type                   | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| authorization     | `String`(*Header*)     | **Required.** Access Token [obtained via OAuth](/pages/b24673/)                |
| client_id         | `String`(*Header*)     | **Required.** Client ID in aiM18 [OAuth Applications](/pages/b24673/)          |
| module            | `String`(*Path*)       | **Required. **Module type,such as 'employee', can be found in data dictionary. |
| menuCode          | `String`(*Query*)      | **Required.** Menu code, such as 'employee', can be found in data dictionary. |
| param             | `jsonString`(*Query*)  | Additional parameters for special actions.                   |
| entity            | ` jsonString`(*Query*) | The Simplified Entity JSON, structure please refer to the below. Notice that the JSON need to be <u>URL Encoded</u>. |
| entitys_in_entity | `String`(Body)         | The Simplified Entity JSON, structure please refer to the below. It is recommended to pass entity JSON in request body.If you want to handle more entitys, please pass an array of Simplified Entity JSON. |

Most parameters are trivial to be found. If you cannot find your authorization and client_id, please check [here](/pages/b24673/).

The only confusing parameter is the `entity`.

Following is an example of an `entity`. It is basically a JSON containing tables and values you are going to save.

```json
{
	"employeepic": {
			"values": [ ]
	},
	"employee_attach": {
			"values": [ ]
	},
	"employee": {
			"values": [
				{"code": "000171","desc": "abcd"}
			]
	}
}
```

By making use of `Data Dictionary` provided in aiM18, you can get all the table information of the Module you need. 

We need to fill in table `Sales Order` and `S.O. (Product)`.

![wst14](/assets/wst14.png)

The table name of `Sales Order` is `mainso`.

![wst15](/assets/wst15.png)

In order to save a SqlEntity successfully, we must at least input all the required fields marked. 

All other fields are optional.

**Sample Data as below**
```json
{
	"mainso": {
	  "values": [
		{
		  "flowTypeId": 1,
		  "code": "MYDEMOSO_001",
		  "tDate": "2018-08-10 00:00:00",
		  "cusId": 1,
		  "curId": 2,
		  "rate": 7.5,
		  "staffId": 11
		}
	  ]
	}
}
```

**FAQ 1:**

How to find out `cusId` (Customer)? Move to [FAQ Section](#faq) for the solution.

The table name of `S.O. (Product)` is `sot`.

![wst16](/assets/wst16.png)

Again, fill in the required fields first and then the optional fields.

**Sample Data as below**
```json
{
	"mainso": {
	  "values": [
		 "flowTypeId": 1,
		 "code": "MYDEMOSO_001",
		 "tDate": "2018-08-10 00:00:00",
		 "cusId": 1,
		 "curId": 2,
		 "rate": 7.5,
		 "staffId": 11
	  ]
	},
	"sot": {
	  "values": [
		{
			"proId": 1,
			"unitId": 2,
			"qty": 10
		},
		{
			"proId": 2,
			"unitId": 3,
			"qty": 7
		}
	  ]
	}
}
```

**FAQ 2:**

How to find out `proId` (Product) or `unitId` (Product Unit) ? Move to [FAQ Section](#faq) for the solution.

Now you should be ready to submit your request.

Back to the scenario, Chris integrates the Online Shop with aiM18 Web Service.

![wst17](/assets/wst17.png)

When an order is confirmed, below HTTP request is send to aiM18 ERP System. 

Sales Order is saved automatically.

**Corresponding Request:**
```java
MediaType jsonMT = MediaType.parse("application/json; charset=utf-8");

RequestBody rb = RequestBody.create(jsonMT,
{
       "sot": {
		   "values": [
				{ "proId": "1",  "qty": "5",  "unitId": "1" },
				{ "proId": "2",  "qty": "4",  "unitId": "1" },
				{ "proId": "3",  "qty": "2",  "unitId": "1" },
				{ "proId": "4",  "qty": "10",  "unitId": "1" }
		   ]
       },
       "mainso": {
		   "values": [
			   {
				   "flowTypeId": "1",
				   "code": "OLDSOOO1",
				   "tDate": "2018-01-01 00:00:00",
				   "cusId": "1", "curId": "1",
				   "rate": "1", "staffId": "1"
			   }
		   ]
       }
}

Request request = new Request.Builder()
       .url("http://[server]]/jsf/rfws/entity/s/save/oldso?menuCode=oldso")
       .put(formBody)
       .addHeader("authorization", "Bearer MjZhZGNjMDctODVhZS00MmE0LWI3ZmEtNzRhMTQ")
       .addHeader("client_id", "C-SGF2aWQncyBhcHBsaWNhdGlvbjIwMTctMDItMTAxNjc=")
       .addHeader("cache-control", "no-cache")
       .build();

Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
```

**Corresponding Response:**
```json
HttpResponseProxy{
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[
   Connection: keep-alive,
   X-Powered-By: Undertow/1,
   Server: WildFly/9,
   Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8,
   Content-Length: 2,
   Date: Thu, 09 Aug 2018 04:59:18 GMT
]

ResponseEntityProxy {
[
   Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8,
   Content-Length: 2,
   Chunked: false
]}
}
```

## Best practice

While you can get all the table and field information for a module through the `Data Dictionary`, this approach is still a bit cumbersome.

The best practice for creating a module record is to get an empty structure via another API and populate it with data.

The steps are as follows:

1. [Get an empty structure via API](/pages/c79a4a/#create-entity)
2. If you are programming in Java, you can convert [the JSON result which return by previous API directly to a SqlEntity](/pages/c42005/)
3. Manipulating the SqlEntity, such as modifying values and filling in rows of a table
4. Convert the SqlEntity to JSON format, that's the `entity` parameter of the [Save Entity](#refer-to-the-document) service.
